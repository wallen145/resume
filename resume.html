                <h2 class="role">Senior Solution Architect</h2>
                <p>My systems and financial background have helped me to understand and apply software technology to solve business problems. I have designed and implemented creative solutions that meet business requirements within cost, time, and architecture
                    constraints.
                </p>
                <p>In addition, I have designed, built and maintained integrations between COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) packages and human resource, financial, email and other internal systems.</p>
                <p>Since our team was downsized during 2017, I also performed business systems analyst duties (about 20% of time), working with internal business representatives (in US, Europe, and Canada) to gather and document requirements for integration
                    development and CA PPM maintenance and upgrade activities.</p>
                <p>My broad skill set enables me to develop and deliver proof-of-concepts, integrations and small applications or capably lead teams of specialists by providing business context and technical direction.</p>
